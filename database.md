## Question 1

Table: ```Person```
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
```
Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.



Example 1:
```
Input:
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
Output:
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.
```

## Question 2

Table: ```Customers```
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
 ```

Table: ```Orders```
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 ```

Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.



Example 1:
```
Input:
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output:
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```
## Question 3

Table: ```Employee```
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
```

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the ```Employee``` table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report ```null```.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```

## Question 4
Table: ```Scores```
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| score       | decimal |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the score of a game. Score is a floating point value with two decimal places.
 ```

Write an SQL query to rank the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:

- The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
- If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
- After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.

Return the result table ordered by ```score``` in descending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
```
Input:
Scores table:
+----+-------+
| id | score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
Output:
+-------+------+
| score | rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```

## Question 5

Table: ```Weather```
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 ```

Write an SQL query to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.



Example 1:
```
Input:
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output:
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation:
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).
```
## Question 6
Table: ```Salary```
```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| sex         | ENUM     |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
The sex column is ENUM value of type ('m', 'f').
The table contains information about an employee.
 ```

Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a **single update statement** and no intermediate temporary tables.

Note that you must write a single update statement, **do not** write any select statement for this problem.

The query result format is in the following example.



Example 1:
```
Input:
Salary table:
+----+------+-----+--------+
| id | name | sex | salary |
+----+------+-----+--------+
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
+----+------+-----+--------+
Output:
+----+------+-----+--------+
| id | name | sex | salary |
+----+------+-----+--------+
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
+----+------+-----+--------+
Explanation:
(1, A) and (3, C) were changed from 'm' to 'f'.
(2, B) and (4, D) were changed from 'f' to 'm'.
